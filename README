AWS Console
===========

The console does:

1. Shows EC2 instances
2. Allows to start and stop instances
3. Allows to mark an instances as "power save" - This will run the instance M-F 8am-6pm and turn them off in off hours
4. Allows to create a new instance based on a saved AMI image

The application does its work inside Akka Actors (both typed and untyped actors). For the typed actor methods that return a value, a Future is returned. In the controller actions they are converted into Play promises of results.

The application uses SecureSocial userpass service for authentication and overrides some of the templates that secure social uses.
